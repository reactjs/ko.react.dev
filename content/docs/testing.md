You can test React components similar to testing other JavaScript code.

There are a few ways to test React components. Broadly, they divide into two categories:

* **Rendering component trees** in a simplified test environment and asserting on their output.
* **Running a complete app** in a realistic browser environment (also known as “end-to-end” tests).

This documentation section focuses on testing strategies for the first case. While full end-to-end tests can be very useful to prevent regressions to important workflows, such tests are not concerned with React components in particular, and are out of scope of this section.

### Tradeoffs {#tradeoffs}


When choosing testing tools, it is worth considering a few tradeoffs:

* **Iteration speed vs Realistic environment:** Some tools offer a very quick feedback loop between making a change and seeing the result, but don't model the browser behavior precisely. Other tools might use a real browser environment, but reduce the iteration speed and are flakier on a continuous integration server.
* **How much to mock:** With components, the distinction between a "unit" and "integration" test can be blurry. If you're testing a form, should its test also test the buttons inside of it? Or should a button component have its own test suite? Should refactoring a button ever break the form test?

Different answers may work for different teams and products.

### Recommended Tools {#tools}

**[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)** is a JavaScript test runner that lets you access the DOM via [`jsdom`](#mocking-a-rendering-surface). While jsdom is only an approximation of how the browser works, it is often good enough for testing React components. Jest provides a great iteration speed combined with powerful features like mocking [modules](#mocking-modules) and [timers](#mocking-timers) so you can have more control over how the code executes.

**[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react)** is a set of helpers that let you test React components without relying on their implementation details. This approach makes refactoring a breeze and also nudges you towards best practices for accessibility. Although it doesn't provide a way to "shallowly" render a component without its children, a test runner like Jest lets you do this by [mocking](/docs/testing-recipes.html#mocking-modules).
