The `Profiler` measures how often a React application renders and what the "cost" of rendering is.
Its purpose is to help identify parts of an application that are slow and may benefit from [optimizations such as memoization](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-memoize-calculations).

> Profiling adds some additional overhead, so **it is disabled in [the production build](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build)**.
>
> To opt into production profiling, React provides a special production build with profiling enabled.

## Usage

A `Profiler` can be added anywhere in a React tree to measure the cost of rendering that part of the tree.
It requires two props: an `id` (string) and an `onRender` callback (function) which React calls any time a component within the tree "commits" an update.

For example, to profile a `Navigation` component and its descendants:

```js{3}
render(
  <App>
    <Profiler id="Navigation" onRender={callback}>
      <Navigation {...props} />
    </Profiler>
    <Main {...props} />
  </App>
);
```

Multiple `Profiler` components can be used to measure different parts of an application:
```js{3,6}
render(
  <App>
    <Profiler id="Navigation" onRender={callback}>
      <Navigation {...props} />
    </Profiler>
    <Profiler id="Main" onRender={callback}>
      <Main {...props} />
    </Profiler>
  </App>
);
```

`Profiler` components can also be nested to measure different components within the same subtree:
```js{2,6,8}
render(
  <App>
    <Profiler id="Panel" onRender={callback}>
      <Panel {...props}>
        <Profiler id="Content" onRender={callback}>
          <Content {...props} />
        </Profiler>
        <Profiler id="PreviewPane" onRender={callback}>
          <PreviewPane {...props} />
        </Profiler>
      </Panel>
    </Profiler>
  </App>
);
```

> Note
>
> Although `Profiler` is a light-weight component, it should be used only when necessary; each use adds some CPU and memory overhead to an application.

## `onRender` Callback

The `Profiler` requires an `onRender` function as a prop.
React calls this function any time a component within the profiled tree "commits" an update.
It receives parameters describing what was rendered and how long it took.

```js
function onRenderCallback(
  id, // the "id" prop of the Profiler tree that has just committed
  phase, // either "mount" (if the tree just mounted) or "update" (if it re-rendered)
  actualDuration, // time spent rendering the committed update
  baseDuration, // estimated time to render the entire subtree without memoization
  startTime, // when React began rendering this update
  commitTime, // when React committed this update
  interactions // the Set of interactions belonging to this update
) {
  // Aggregate or log render timings...
}
```

Let's take a closer look at each of the props:

* **`id: string`** - 
The `id` prop of the `Profiler` tree that has just committed.
This can be used to identify which part of the tree was committed if you are using multiple profilers.
* **`phase: "mount" | "update"`** -
Identifies whether the tree has just been mounted for the first time or re-rendered due to a change in props, state, or hooks.
* **`actualDuration: number`** -
Time spent rendering the `Profiler` and its descendants for the current update.
This indicates how well the subtree makes use of memoization (e.g. [`React.memo`](/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo), [`useMemo`](/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo), [`shouldComponentUpdate`](/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-do-i-implement-shouldcomponentupdate)).
Ideally this value should decrease significantly after the initial mount as many of the descendants will only need to re-render if their specific props change.
* **`baseDuration: number`** -
Duration of the most recent `render` time for each individual component within the `Profiler` tree.
This value estimates a worst-case cost of rendering (e.g. the initial mount or a tree with no memoization).
* **`startTime: number`** -
Timestamp when React began rendering the current update.
* **`commitTime: number`** -
Timestamp when React committed the current update.
This value is shared between all profilers in a commit, enabling them to be grouped if desirable.
* **`interactions: Set`** -
Set of ["interactions"](http://fb.me/react-interaction-tracing) that were being traced the update was scheduled (e.g. when `render` or `setState` were called).

> Note
>
> Interactions can be used to identify the cause of an update, although the API for tracing them is still experimental.
