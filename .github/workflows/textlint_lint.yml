        # The `--frozen-lockfile` flag in Yarn ensures that dependencies are installed without modifying the `yarn.lock` file. It is useful for maintaining consistency in CI/CD environments by preventing unexpected changes to the lock file and ensuring that the same versions of dependencies are installed.
