<Intro>

이 블로그는 React 팀에서 업데이트한 내용들의 공식 소스입니다. 릴리스 노트 및 더 이상 사용되지 않는 표현에 대한 알림을 비롯하여 중요한 내용은 이곳에 먼저 공유됩니다. 또, 트위터에서 [@reactjs](https://twitter.com/reactjs) 계정을 팔로우하셔도 좋지만, 이 블로그만으로도 모든 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다.

<BlogCard title="React Canaries: Incremental Feature Rollout Outside Meta" date="May 3, 2023" url="/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries">

Traditionally, new React features used to only be available at Meta first, and land in the open source releases later. We'd like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new features as soon as their design is close to final--similar to how Meta uses React internally. We are introducing a new officially supported Canary release channel. It lets curated setups like frameworks decouple adoption of individual React features from the React release schedule.

React 18 was years in the making, and with it brought valuable lessons for the React team. Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights. One lesson we’ve learned is that it’s frustrating for the community to wait for new features without having insight into these paths that we’re exploring...
