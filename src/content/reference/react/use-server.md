## 레퍼런스 {/*reference*/}

### `'use server'` {/*use-server*/}

함수가 클라이언트에서 실행될 수 있음을 표시하기 위해, 비동기 함수의 맨 위에 `'use server';`를 추가하세요. 우리는 이를 _Server Actions_ 이라고 부릅니다.

```js {2}
async function addToCart(data) {
  'use server';
  // ...
}
```

When calling a Server Action on the client, it will make a network request to the server that includes a serialized copy of any arguments passed. If the Server Action returns a value, that value will be serialized and returned to the client.

Instead of individually marking functions with `'use server'`, you can add the directive to the top of a file to mark all exports within that file as Server Actions that can be used anywhere, including imported in client code.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}
* `'use server'` must be at the very beginning of their function or module; above any other code including imports (comments above directives are OK). They must be written with single or double quotes, not backticks.
* `'use server'` can only be used in server-side files. The resulting Server Actions can be passed to Client Components through props. See supported [types for serialization](#serializable-parameters-and-return-values).
* To import a Server Action from [client code](/reference/react/use-client), the directive must be used on a module level.
* Because the underlying network calls are always asynchronous, `'use server'` can only be used on async functions.
* Always treat arguments to Server Actions as untrusted input and authorize any mutations. See [security considerations](#security).
* Server Actions should be called in a [transition](/reference/react/useTransition). Server Actions passed to [`<form action>`](/reference/react-dom/components/form#props) or [`formAction`](/reference/react-dom/components/input#props) will automatically be called in a transition.
* Server Actions are designed for mutations that update server-side state; they are not recommended for data fetching. Accordingly, frameworks implementing Server Actions typically process one action at a time and do not have a way to cache the return value.

### Security considerations {/*security*/}

Arguments to Server Actions are fully client-controlled. For security, always treat them as untrusted input, and make sure to validate and escape arguments as appropriate.

In any Server Action, make sure to validate that the logged-in user is allowed to perform that action.

<Wip>

To prevent sending sensitive data from a Server Action, there are experimental taint APIs to prevent unique values and objects from being passed to client code.

See [experimental_taintUniqueValue](/reference/react/experimental_taintUniqueValue) and [experimental_taintObjectReference](/reference/react/experimental_taintObjectReference).

</Wip>

### Serializable arguments and return values {/*serializable-parameters-and-return-values*/}

As client code calls the Server Action over the network, any arguments passed will need to be serializable.

Here are supported types for Server Action arguments:

* Primitives
	* [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/String)
	* [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Number)
	* [bigint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)
	* [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean)
	* [undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Undefined)
	* [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null)
	* [symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol), only symbols registered in the global Symbol registry via [`Symbol.for`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/for)
* Iterables containing serializable values
	* [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
	* [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
	* [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)
	* [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
	* [TypedArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) and [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer)
* [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
* [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) instances
* Plain [objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object): those created with [object initializers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer), with serializable properties
* Functions that are Server Actions
* [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

Notably, these are not supported:
* React elements, or [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
* Functions, including component functions or any other function that is not a Server Action
* [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript)
* Objects that are instances of any class (other than the built-ins mentioned) or objects with [a null prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#null-prototype_objects)
* Symbols not registered globally, ex. `Symbol('my new symbol')`


Supported serializable return values are the same as [serializable props](/reference/react/use-client#passing-props-from-server-to-client-components) for a boundary Client Component.


## 사용법 {/*usage*/}

### Server Actions in forms {/*server-actions-in-forms*/}

The most common use case of Server Actions will be calling server functions that mutate data. On the browser, the [HTML form element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) is the traditional approach for a user to submit a mutation. With React Server Components, React introduces first-class support for Server Actions in [forms](/reference/react-dom/components/form).

Here is a form that allows a user to request a username.

```js [[1, 3, "formData"]]
// App.js

async function requestUsername(formData) {
  'use server';
  const username = formData.get('username');
  // ...
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <form action={requestUsername}>
      <input type="text" name="username" />
      <button type="submit">Request</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

In this example `requestUsername` is a Server Action passed to a `<form>`. When a user submits this form, there is a network request to the server function `requestUsername`. When calling a Server Action in a form, React will supply the form's <CodeStep step={1}>[FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)</CodeStep> as the first argument to the Server Action.

By passing a Server Action to the form `action`, React can [progressively enhance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) the form. This means that forms can be submitted before the JavaScript bundle is loaded.

#### Handling return values in forms {/*handling-return-values*/}

In the username request form, there might be the chance that a username is not available. `requestUsername` should tell us if it fails or not.

To update the UI based on the result of a Server Action while supporting progressive enhancement, use [`useFormState`](/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormState).

```js
// requestUsername.js
'use server';

export default async function requestUsername(formData) {
  const username = formData.get('username');
  if (canRequest(username)) {
    // ...
    return 'successful';
  }
  return 'failed';
}
```

```js {4,8}, [[2, 2, "'use client'"]]
// UsernameForm.js
'use client';

import {useFormState} from 'react-dom';
import requestUsername from './requestUsername';

function UsernameForm() {
  const [returnValue, action] = useFormState(requestUsername, 'n/a');

  return (
    <>
      <form action={action}>
        <input type="text" name="username" />
        <button type="submit">Request</button>
      </form>
      <p>Last submission request returned: {returnValue}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

Note that like most Hooks, `useFormState` can only be called in <CodeStep step={1}>[client code](/reference/react/use-client)</CodeStep>.

### Calling a Server Action outside of `<form>` {/*calling-a-server-action-outside-of-form*/}

Server Actions are exposed server endpoints and can be called anywhere in client code.

When using a Server Action outside of a [form](/reference/react-dom/components/form), call the Server Action in a [transition](/reference/react/useTransition), which allows you to display a loading indicator, show [optimistic state updates](/reference/react/useOptimistic), and handle unexpected errors. Forms will automatically wrap Server Actions in transitions.

```js {9-12}
import incrementLike from './actions';
import { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

function LikeButton() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const [likeCount, setLikeCount] = useState(0);

  const onClick = () => {
    startTransition(async () => {
      const currentCount = await incrementLike();
      setLikeCount(currentCount);
    });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <p>Total Likes: {likeCount}</p>
      <button onClick={onClick} disabled={isPending}>Like</button>;
    </>
  );
}
```

```js
// actions.js
'use server';

let likeCount = 0;
export default async incrementLike() {
  likeCount++;
  return likeCount;
}
```

To read a Server Action return value, you'll need to `await` the promise returned.
