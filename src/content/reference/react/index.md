</Intro>

Our The React reference documentation is broken down into functional subsections:

## React {/*react*/}

Programmatic React features:

* [Hooks](/reference/react/hooks) - Use different React features from your components.
* [Components](/reference/react/components) - Documents built-in components that you can use in your JSX.
* [APIs](/reference/react/apis) - APIs that are useful for defining components.
* [Directives](/reference/react/directives) - Provide instructions to bundlers compatible with React Server Components.

## React DOM {/*react-dom*/}

React-dom contains features that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). This section is broken into the following:

* [Hooks](/reference/react-dom/hooks) - Hooks for web applications which run in the browser DOM environment.
* [Components](/reference/react-dom/components) - React supports all of the browser built-in HTML and SVG components.
* [APIs](/reference/react-dom) - The `react-dom` package contains methods supported only in web applications.
* [Client APIs](/reference/react-dom/client) - The `react-dom/client` APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser).
* [Server APIs](/reference/react-dom/server) - The `react-dom/server` APIs let you render React components to HTML on the server.

## Legacy APIs {/*legacy-apis*/}

* [Legacy APIs](/reference/react/legacy) - Exported from the `react` package, but not recommended for use in newly written code.
