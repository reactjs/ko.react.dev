## What is this site? {/*what-is-this-site*/}

We are rewriting the React documentation with a few differences:

- All explanations are **written using Hooks** rather than classes.
- We've added **interactive examples** and visual diagrams.
- Guides include **challenges (with solutions!)** to check your understanding.

This beta website contains the current draft of the new docs.

## How much content is ready? {/*how-much-content-is-ready*/}

* [Learn React](/learn): ~95% finished.
* [API Reference](/apis): ~70% finished.

You can track our progress [on GitHub.](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/3308)

## How can I provide feedback? {/*how-can-i-provide-feedback*/}

Please use [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/3308) or [this anonymous form](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/PYRPF3X) for high-level feedback. If you spot something that doesn't make sense, please tell us! Additionally, each page has thumbs up/down buttons in the corner.

## Will this site replace the main site? {/*will-this-site-replace-the-main-site*/}

We aim to switch this site to be the main one once we reach content parity with the [existing React documentation.](https://reactjs.org/) The old React website will be archived at a subdomain so you'll still be able to access it. Old content links will redirect to the archived subdomain, which will have a notice about outdated content.
